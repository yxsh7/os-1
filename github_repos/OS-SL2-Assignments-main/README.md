## Statements
Assignment No. 1

	Shell programming
	Write a program to implement an address book with options given below:
	a) Create address book. b) View address book. c) Insert a record. d) Delete a record.
	e) Modify a record. f) Exit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 2

	Process control system calls: The demonstration of FORK, EXECVE and WAIT system calls
	along with zombie and orphan states.

	a. Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted. Main
	program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process
	sorts the integers using sorting algorithm and waits for child process using WAIT system call to
	sort the integers using any sorting algorithm. Also demonstrate zombie and orphan states.
	b. Implement the C program in which main program accepts an integer array. Main program uses
	the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process sorts an
	integer array and passes the sorted array to child process through the command line arguments
	of EXECVE system call. The child process uses EXECVE system call to load new program that uses
	this sorted array for performing the binary search to search the particular item in the array.

Assignment No. 3

	Implement multithreading for Matrix Multiplication using pthreads.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 4

	Thread synchronization using counting semaphores. Application to demonstrate:
	producer-consumer problem with counting semaphores and mutex.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 5

	Thread synchronization and mutual exclusion using mutex. Application to demonstrate:
	Reader-Writer problem with reader priority.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 6

	Deadlock Avoidance Using Semaphores: Implement the deadlock-free solution to Dining
	Philosophers problem to illustrate the problem of deadlock and/or starvation that can occur when many
	synchronized threads are competing for limited resources.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 7

	Inter process communication in Linux using following.

	a. Pipes: Full duplex communication between parent and child processes. Parent process writes a
	pathname of a file (the contents of the file are desired) on one pipe to be read by child process
	and child process writes the contents of the file on second pipe to be read by parent process and
	displays on standard output.
	b. FIFOs: Full duplex communication between two independent processes. First process accepts
	sentences and writes on one pipe to be read by second process and second process counts
	number of characters, number of words and number of lines in accepted sentences, writes this
	output in a text file and writes the contents of the file on second pipe to be read by first process 
	and displays on standard output.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 8

	Inter-process Communication using Shared Memory using System V. Application to
	demonstrate: Client and Server Programs in which server process creates a shared memory segment and
	writes the message to the shared memory segment. Client process reads the message from the shared
	memory segment and displays it to the screen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 9

	Implement an assignment using File Handling System Calls (Low level system calls like
	open, read, write, etc).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment No. 10

	Implement a new system call in the kernel space, add this new system call in the Linux
	kernel by the compilation of this kernel (any kernel source, any architecture and any Linux kernel
	distribution) and demonstrate the use of this embedded system call using C program in user space.
